# confession-site
Confession website will act as a platform for college students to share any personal fact or admit any experience which they feel open to sharing with other students. 

Confession website acts as a medium for students to express their emotions, beliefs, and troubles anonymously. It will also act as a de facto message board where students can ask for help regarding any issues related to college affairs.
